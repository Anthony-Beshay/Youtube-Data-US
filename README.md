# Youtube-Data-US
In this project, using tableau, I created a visualization of dataset that includes a bunch of information for videos that were trending for at least one day.
The repository contains 3 files. The first file is a report discussing the questions that I tried to investigate in this project, and a URL for each of the visualiztions and the dashboard.
The other 2 CSV files were joined and used to answer the questions.
